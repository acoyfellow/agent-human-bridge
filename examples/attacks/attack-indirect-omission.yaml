# Attack: indirect-omission
# Validator behavior: REJECTED (direct evidence exists for critical constraint)
# When direct evidence exists for a functional/negative/performance constraint,
# labeling it as "indirect" is rejected because the constraint requires direct red.

  summary: Add rate limiting to API endpoints
  constraints:
  - id: C1
    statement: API rejects requests exceeding 1000 req/min from single IP
    type: functional
  - id: C2
    statement: Rate limiting does not affect authorized service-to-service calls
    type: compatibility
