# Agent–Human Bridge Spec (AHS) — Summary

This package encodes a conservative bridge from deterministic engineering instincts to agent-mediated building.

Core invariants:
- Correctness is externally defined.
- Responsibility is non-transferable.
- No green without prior red.
- No silent goalpost moves.
- Observability precedes confidence.

Deliverables:
- State machine of the workflow
- Audit record schema + validator
- Minimal vocabulary to prevent drift
- Adversarial suite to test cheating

Roadmap:
- Add relevance coupling (direct/indirect/incidental) to prevent irrelevant reds.
- Build a Challenge Pack so skeptical humans can falsify the protocol by inspection.

North Star:
**Leverage without abdication.**
